## Summary
A brief one-paragraph description of the problem being solved and the proposed solution.

## Background and Motivation
Describe the context and motivation for the Secure Artifact Manager. Why is this needed? What problems does it solve for users?

## Detailed Design

### System Architecture
Outline the high-level architecture of your solution:
- Component diagram
- Data flow
- Key technologies and libraries
- API design

### Containerization Strategy
Detail your approach to containerization:
- Container structure and organization
- Multi-stage build process
- Security hardening measures
- Local development setup with Docker Compose (if Level 1)

### Kubernetes Architecture (for Levels 2-5)
Detail your Kubernetes deployment plan appropriate to your target level:

**For Level 2:**
- Resource organization (namespaces, labels, etc.)
- Basic deployment manifests approach
- ConfigMap and Secret management
- Resource limits and requests

**For Level 3:**
- Kind cluster configuration
- Component deployments and their relationships
- Service definitions and networking approach
- Storage requirements and persistent volume strategy
- Ingress configuration and TLS
- Deployment method (scripts, Helm charts, etc.)

**For Level 4:**
- GitOps implementation details
- Advanced security controls
- Monitoring and observability setup
- Autoscaling configuration
- Backup and recovery strategy

### Data Models
Define the core data models and their relationships:
```
type Artifact struct {
    // Fields
}

type User struct {
    // Fields
}

// Additional models
```

### Security Design
Detail your approach to security:
- Authentication and authorization strategy
- Data encryption (at rest and in transit)
- Secret management
- Vulnerability scanning implementation
- Input validation and security controls
- Container security considerations
- Kubernetes security considerations (if applicable to your level)

### User Experience
Describe the key user interfaces and flows:
- Wireframes or mockups for main screens (optional)
- Navigation structure
- Error handling from a user perspective

## Implementation Strategy
Outline your implementation approach:
- Phasing of features
- Development priorities
- Testing strategy 
- CI/CD approach (if applicable)
- Key milestones

## Containerization and Deployment Considerations
Describe your approach based on your target level:

**Level 1 - Containerization:**
- Container image design and optimization
- Docker Compose setup for local development
- Security considerations for containers

**Level 2 - Kubernetes Manifests:**
- Manifest organization and structure
- Configuration management
- Manual deployment process
