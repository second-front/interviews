# 2F Technical Interview Process

This repository contains technical interview challenges designed to evaluate candidates in a way that reflects our actual working environment at 2F. We believe traditional interviews often fail to assess a candidate's true capabilities, so we've developed a process that better aligns with our engineering culture and workflow.

## Our Approach & Motivation

Traditional technical interviews have limitations:
- They test artificial problems in artificial environments
- They create unnecessary stress that doesn't reflect day-to-day work
- They don't assess collaboration, which is critical to our success

Instead, our process:
- Uses realistic challenges that mirror actual work at 2F
- Incorporates our RFD-based design process
- Evaluates both technical skills and collaboration
- Gives candidates time to think and work as they would on the job

## Core Assessment Areas

1. **Software Engineering Aptitude**: Problem-solving, code quality, technical design
2. **Security Consciousness**: Building secure systems from the ground up
3. **Workflow Systems Knowledge**: Familiarity with CI/CD, GitOps, and automation
4. **Collaborative Skills**: Communication, responsiveness to feedback, teamwork

## Our Process

Candidates participate in a multi-stage challenge:

1. **RFD Creation**: Develop a Request for Discussion document outlining their approach
2. **Collaborative Refinement**: Engage with our team to improve the design
3. **Implementation**: Build a solution based on the approved design
4. **Review**: Present and discuss their work with our engineering team

This process closely mirrors how we actually work at 2F, giving both sides a realistic preview of the working relationship.

## Technical Requirements

- Backend APIs must be written in Go or Rust
- Frontend components must use React with TypeScript
- All solutions should incorporate security best practices
- Code must be properly tested and documented

## Repository Structure

- `/challenges/` - Challenge descriptions and requirements
- `/challenges/templates/` - RFD templates and guidelines
- `/challenges/candidate-guide.md` - Comprehensive guide for candidates
- `/reviewer-rubric.md` - Evaluation criteria for reviewers

## For Challenge Creators

When developing new challenges:
1. Focus on realistic problems that test engineering aptitude
2. Ensure security and compliance aspects are represented
3. Design graduated difficulty levels (1-5)
4. Create clear evaluation criteria
5. Provide comprehensive documentation
